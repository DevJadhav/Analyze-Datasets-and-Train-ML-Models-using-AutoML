# Analyze-Datasets-and-Train-ML-Models-using-AutoML

This repository contains the course materials for "Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML" offered by DeepLearning.AI and Amazon Web Services (AWS). This course is the first part of the Practical Data Science Specialization on Coursera.


**Course Description**

This course equips you with foundational concepts in:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)
* Text Classification Algorithms

You'll leverage Amazon SageMaker tools like:

* **Clarify** - Analyze datasets for statistical bias.
* **Data Wrangler** - Transform data into machine-readable formats and select relevant features.
* **Autopilot** - Automate machine learning tasks like training, tuning, and deployment for text classification.
* **BlazingText** - Train text classifiers with minimal coding using a highly-optimized FastText implementation.

The course emphasizes practical data science using the cloud's agility and scalability to handle massive datasets. You'll learn to develop and deploy end-to-end machine learning pipelines on AWS SageMaker, encompassing both automated and manual approaches.

**Target Audience**

This specialization is designed for individuals with experience in Python and SQL who are interested in:

* Data-focused developers
* Scientists
* Analysts

You'll gain the skills to build, train, and deploy scalable machine learning pipelines in the AWS cloud.

**Prerequisites**

* Familiarity with Python and SQL programming languages.

**Getting Started**

This repository contains the course materials, but enrollment in the Coursera specialization is recommended for a complete learning experience, including video lectures, quizzes, and hands-on labs.
