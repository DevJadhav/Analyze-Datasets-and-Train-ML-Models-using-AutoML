# Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the second course of the Practical Data Science Specialization. This course focuses on automating a natural language processing (NLP) task by building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using the advanced capabilities of Hugging Faceâ€™s BERT algorithm and Amazon SageMaker Pipelines.

## What You'll Learn
This course offers a deep dive into building scalable machine learning pipelines for text classification using some of the most powerful tools available in the cloud:

**BERT and Hugging Face:** Utilize Hugging Face's highly-optimized implementation of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) algorithm, which excels in understanding human language based on extensive training over diverse datasets like Wikipedia.
**Amazon SageMaker Pipelines:** Learn to orchestrate ML workflows using Amazon SageMaker Pipelines, ensuring efficient management and automation of machine learning tasks.
**Feature Store:** Transform and store datasets into features compatible with BERT using the Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, enabling efficient retrieval and management of data for ML training.
**Model Training and Evaluation:** Fine-tune a pre-trained text classification model and evaluate its accuracy to ensure it meets specific performance criteria before deployment.

## Course Structure
This course is structured to guide you through setting up, developing, and deploying an NLP pipeline:

**Data Transformation:** Convert raw data into BERT-readable features and store these in the SageMaker Feature Store.
**Model Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune a Hugging Face pre-trained model to your specific dataset, leveraging the model's prior training on a vast corpus of text.
**Model Evaluation and Deployment:** Evaluate the model's performance and deploy it only if it achieves an accuracy threshold, ensuring robustness in real-world applications.
