-1,This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.,Blouses
-1,Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.,Blouses
-1,I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.,Blouses
-1,Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm?     this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.,Blouses
-1,I'm 5' 7 and bough a size 8 regular. this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff. cute pattern  but i'm returning it.,Blouses
-1,The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,Blouses
-1,This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.,Blouses
-1,I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5'  106#  34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized  or defective. all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you'll love it.,Blouses
-1,I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen  in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover  the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.  overpriced  to boot.  obviously  mine is a minority opinion.,Blouses
0,I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest  it was shorter than i usually like my tops  so i will be returning it.,Blouses
0,I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.,Blouses
0,This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs  however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits  but something to be aware of.,Blouses
0,True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut!,Blouses
0,Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife  but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.,Blouses
0,It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,Blouses
0,I'm 5'7  125lbs  and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs)  and the body fits loosely  without looking sloppy. at my height  the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic  which is fine.    unfortunately  the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt  so i had to wash it before wearing it.    i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.,Blouses
0,I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall  i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...,Blouses
0,This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.,Blouses
1,This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer  but does not fit me like the photo size down,Blouses
1,Love this flowing  cute top! casual  but can be easily dressed up. great fit.,Blouses
1,Love this top. very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing. the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.,Blouses
1,Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store.,Blouses
1,Absolutely stunning. the color  the pattern  the quality. i love everything about this top.,Blouses
1,"This shirt is made of fabric so soft you can practically feel it with your eyes. i saw it right when i walked into the store and knew that i had to have it. it is unlike any fabric i've ever had: a soft two-ply  almost gauzy cotton. one cute detail is that the ""inside"" layer is a smaller windowpane plaid than the outside layer. so cute! and so soft! one thickness above cheesecloth  i would say. and like cheesecloth  it has a natural ""give"" within the weave  but it is not stretchy. the shoulders",Blouses
1,Super simple top that's comfy. i like a looser fit and its boxy- both things i like. seems like it will be a staple piece.,Blouses
1,The color pattern in this material pops a lot more in person than on the website. fits perfectly  very versatile regardless of the occasion or the season (at least in california!). love it.,Blouses
1,I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium  size 8  short-waisted  34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique  appealing design  excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right  the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!)  the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme  and finally  admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di,Blouses
-1,I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box  but when i started to unbutton it to try it on  two buttons split in half! it's going right back.,Dresses
-1,Ugh  the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but  the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok  if not a tad big  but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.,Dresses
-1,I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!,Dresses
-1,This dress is huge. also  i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse  more like a poplin  and thin. i thought it looked cheap.,Dresses
-1,This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.,Dresses
-1,I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow  but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.,Dresses
-1,I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!,Dresses
-1,I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun  but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline,Dresses
-1,I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but,Dresses
0,This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.,Dresses
0,"I am 5'4""  100lbs  petite frame  i bought this dress in xxsp. the fabric was good quality and thicker than i have imagined  good for fall  maybe a little warm for the hot humid summer days  but perhaps a cooler summer day. unfortunately this dress runs pretty large  much too large for my petite frame  so i had to return it. i would recommend sizing down. this dress is very beautiful and would be great to wear to work or out for after work drinks  also maybe a bridal shower or other brunch event.",Dresses
0,The fabric is flimsy and not substantial. i thought it ran a little small. i usually wear a large in this style  but it was too tight.,Dresses
0,I ordered the blue dress because i loved the color and unique design. the blue was much more of a dark navy  not a sapphire blue as it looks in the picture. the picture also shows it tying on the side. it did not tie on the side when i tried it on but in the front as pictured in the red version of the dress. it was not at all flattering on me. one of the few disappointing things i have ordered from retailer.,Dresses
0,The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.,Dresses
0,This is a shift dress  which is a great dress for many people  in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that  i mean  a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes  good legs  a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however  when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves  you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck  just a bit lower than this  because it makes,Dresses
0,Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.,Dresses
0,I'm 5'8 128lbs and bought a size 2. i loved this dress  but didn't expect to have to go bra-less or wear a tube top under. the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely.     i ordered a size 2,Dresses
0,This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant,Dresses
1,I love this dress. the length is great and the dress just feels great. the material is raw silk (which i love) and the sizing does run a tad large  but with the make of the dress. i can lose weight and still wear the dress. well made and the buttons in back are super cute.,Dresses
1,"I have never been able to find a maxi dress that just fits me. i'm pretty short (5'2"") and the xs petite comes exactly to my ankles. no hemming necessary! the neckline is very flattering and the waist is a semi-empire elastic waistline that makes this dress both elegant and comfortable. the dress is very stretchy but doesn't look like it. it is absolutely one of my ""summer staples"" now - especially for traveling. if i could have this dress in fifty different patterns i would.",Dresses
1,This dress is gorgeous. it is better in person than online. i love the detail of the pleats and the waist. it is light weight and perfectly lines and a beautiful dress for twirling with a martini in hand. in fact  my sister tried to steal it from during a recent trip to europe. it is that adorable and flattering - highly recommend!,Dresses
1,I love this dress! i wore it to my friends bridal shower and got so many compliments! i can't wait to wear it again!,Dresses
1,Fabulous dress!  clip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back (you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer).,Dresses
1,"I purchased the dress on a promotion.  the dress i received had the sleeves end about the elbow.  i added a 4"" black cotton lace to the sleeves.  i love the result.  it makes the design richer and brings out the lace running down the front of the dress.  the sleeves are a much better length for me now.  dress runs tts.  i purchased a medium  am 5'7""  150 lbs  really am large boned  straight up and down.",Dresses
1,...and another addition to my wedding guest wardrobe! the skirt print is gorgeous and i can't wait to shop for the perfect shoe and accessories. i'm very hippy with a thinner waist and this hides that. i love the pockets and the fact that i can wear a regular  comfortable bra. all-around a great purchase!,Dresses
1,I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.,Dresses
1,This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m  only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift  i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings  soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it's a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe,Dresses
-1,Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front  bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!,Fine gauge
-1,I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.,Fine gauge
-1,Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?,Fine gauge
-1,Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return  sadly.,Fine gauge
-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.,Fine gauge
-1,I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.,Fine gauge
-1,I wanted to love this. however  the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.,Fine gauge
-1,I was so excited to try this on in the store  because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately  it is not like the picture. the material is very thin  almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i'll skip this one.,Fine gauge
-1,I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build,Fine gauge
0,Love the design and the gold color  but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...,Fine gauge
0,On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.,Fine gauge
0,I really wanted to love this sweater after reading the reviews but when i received it i was sadly disappointed. it is pretty boxy and not much shape. could be cute for casual outfits but i was looking for some dressier sweaters.,Fine gauge
0,A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!,Fine gauge
0,I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring  and it seemed perfect. plus  the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed  but i'd say surprised.     i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly  i would prefer it to be less stretchy  but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality,Fine gauge
0,This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however  it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.,Fine gauge
0,This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.,Fine gauge
0,I really like the idea behind this top  but at least for me  the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work  but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move  you can see a lot). if you don't move  the front panel is pretty opaque  which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness  so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked,Fine gauge
0,The smallest size  xs  was big on me  i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape  doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though  but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green  made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.    for reference xs bog on 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.,Fine gauge
1,"Finally a ""swing top"" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style  but everything i've tried so far just looks ""dumpy"" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7"" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a ""swing"" style  it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!",Fine gauge
1,I can't believe how much i paid for this top~got free shipping special; so worth it. i ordered the blue and i love it! size small fits perfectly. i am into peplum tops lately  they are so flattering with highwaisted jeans. i usually wear a size 4-6 in retailer.,Fine gauge
1,I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering  lightweight  and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.,Fine gauge
1,I like the grey pattern and black and white contrast versions the best! very soft and falls nicely on my bust. the biggest differences wit the sizes are on length  so i ordered up for it would be a bit longer. it's a great piece.,Fine gauge
1,I ordered both colors  but ended up keeping the green in petite xs b/c the red in xs was just slightly too big. both colors are gorgeous  and i agree they have a retro 70's vibe. just a tad itchy  but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary. i'll probably just wear it alone. i think the regular size would work for most petites b/c it's not ridiculously long. i would suggest sizing down in regular if you're petite though: for instance  the regular xs fit noticeably larger,Fine gauge
1,"I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small  so if you are between sizes  order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here  i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t",Fine gauge
1,Beautiful detail. sweater is warm  soft  and very comfortable. fits perfectly. i was worried without having seen it in person that the lace detailing would be fragile  but it is knitted into the underlying sweater material. i have worn it no less than five times already and not a flaw or a pull in it.,Fine gauge
1,Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much. i've had the black and white for about 2 years now and they are still intact! only the buttons fall off once in a while but that's when i'm being aggressive and on the go buttoning. the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection!,Fine gauge
1,I'm a little on the short side  i was afraid it was going to be too long in the back. the sweater is perfect all the way around. i like the looseness in the front and like the way it lays in the back. the color is great.,Fine gauge
-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,Intimates
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
-1,"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!",Intimates
-1,This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.,Intimates
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
-1,The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(,Intimates
-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I love and live in these but the recent scoop tanks i purchased were thin  not as great. so i want to recommend them because they are really versatile but the quality has deminished.,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
1,Cute little sleep mask! the elastic band is wide so it doesn't ever feel like it's digging into your head. does a very good job keeping out light.,Intimates
1,This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said  great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.,Intimates
1,I love this gown so much  i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy  beautiful  and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite  hands down.,Intimates
1,These undergarments are comfortable  streamlined  and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first  but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable.,Intimates
1,"I am usually a 32a. i ended up with a 34 b based on sales assoc input and what was available. the 32 gave me back fat ( i do not have back fat) so she said the 34 would be better  it ran small etc. the 34 also fit ( had to be ordered and mailed) but it still gave me ""flab"" over the back band. comparing it to my other regular bras  i can see that the band has too thin fabric and rolls and has ""harder edges"" compared to wider   thicker band on my other bras. very pretty but i will be returning. sa",Intimates
1,I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!,Intimates
1,The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.,Intimates
1,While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head  i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!,Intimates
1,I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.,Intimates
-1,The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,Jackets
-1,This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.,Jackets
-1,Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.,Jackets
-1,This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!,Jackets
-1,This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back,Jackets
-1,Even at a very deep discount  this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it  but as i discovered when it arrived  that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for,Jackets
-1,I ordered this vest in xxs  since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then  the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big  not artfully drapey.,Jackets
-1,I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon,Jackets
-1,Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.,Jackets
0,"For reference  i'm 113 lbs  with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft  comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line  it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also  it is a ""mixed-media/material"" type. for example  it's linen with soft leather accents  which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar  on the wrist area ",Jackets
0,If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.,Jackets
0,This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.,Jackets
0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!,Jackets
0,Should have ordered the xl instead of the large. didn't even come close to being able to button the front but i'm a 34 g. i find sanctuary to run small. beautiful soft green color  fabric is soft too. it is cropped to the waist. decided to return instead of reorder.,Jackets
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last",Jackets
0,I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.,Jackets
0,Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200 00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale  i will most likely buy it.,Jackets
0,I snagged this the first day i wore it with my wedding ring. it is very delicate and i can't wear it when i'm with my kids because they pull on it so much! it will just me by night out wrap i guess!!!,Jackets
1,As other reviewers have pointed out  this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight  and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve  but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.,Jackets
1,I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the,Jackets

1,I have always liked this look so ordered my usual size s. fit is good & looks pretty much on me as in the pic - even the arm length works - not too long. i don't care for the placement of the top buttons which are just cosmetic. they dangle downwards showing more of the loop than the button itself. placement is not directly over the bottom buttons  which puts it in the lower breast area. mmmmm... not the look i want. looks unattractive. if i keep this  i will have to move the buttons more in lin,Jackets
1,I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.,Jackets
1,I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch  nice styling details  great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!,Jackets
1,I'm sad i was unable to get an xs  as the small is somewhat big on my 125-lb 5'6 frame. i'm keeping it for the sale price though! when i put it on in the store i got so many compliments from other customers who went to find it! i think it is meant to run large  and honestly i still think even with it looking big it still looked better in person than the model. i would recommend ordering it if you can and don't mind pieces that drape like this!,Jackets
1,I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and it's perfect for that- it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest!,Jackets
1,I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers  boots  dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body  and a little loose  but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.,Jackets
-1,I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that,Jeans
-1,I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size  they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable)  but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th,Jeans
-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans
-1,Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though  i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans  i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered (same review there).  so back both pairs went.   it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.,Jeans
-1,I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally  i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.,Jeans

-1,This picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off. they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture. they also run very small.,Jeans
-1,I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however  i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans  the same  from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn't live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale  i was not happy with the quality.,Jeans
0,Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit  more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.,Jeans

0,First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind  i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.  ----------  i typically wear a 27-29  depending on the brand and waist rise. these were an online return t,Jeans
0,I ordered these in my usual size and could barely get them on. they fit ike tight leggings. they have spandex that is comfortable and they will probably stretch as you wear them . i exchanged for the next size up  because the style is great for year -round and the quality excellent. i live 2 hours from a store  i would either order up at least one size or try them on in store.,Jeans
0,I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle  so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198  in my opinion.,Jeans
0,I still have mixed feelings about this pants. the fabric is nice  soft and flows well. the fit is good  i ordered 30  could have gone with 29  not a big deal. the one thing that is off is the length - i am 5.7 and these come right to above my ankle...nowhere close to how they sit on the model. the issue with this length is that is neither here nor there  too short for regular pant length and too long for crops. i will probably have to hem them a bit  which is a disappointment when you pay so muc,Jeans
0,The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.,Jeans

0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,Layering
1,This is a super flattering  cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute  casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!,Layering
1,Great material  and i like the idea of a scoop / v neck combination. but the hem rolls up  making it impossible to wear not tucked in to pants or a skirt (and even there it's a little bulky). it's possible that ordering a size up would fix the problem.,Layering
1,I love the pure and good short sleeve tees. they feel beautiful  and wash beautifully! i just hang them to dry and they are perfect for the next time  i buy a size medium as i like them to flow nicely at the hips!,Layering
1,This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black. ---------- unless you are very small framed  i would recommend sizing up; or  if you typically wear a m or a l  go with the l. as reference i have wide shoulders (wider than my hips)  large biceps  and a 34b chest  and i went with the l because,Layering
1,This is a cute top. not perfectly made  a little boxy  but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.,Layering
1,I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected  but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles  especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable  and if you are large chested  i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh,Layering
1,I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank  but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!,Layering
1,I bought the white tank and the small fits me but it's very low cut for me. the white is sheer as well. i usually wear an xs or a small and i would be curious to see what the xs would fit like in the sense of how low cut it is.,Layering
1,I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit  but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!,Layering
-1,"These socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow  i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.",Legwear
-1,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.,Legwear
-1,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee  it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet,Legwear
-1,I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.,Legwear
-1,The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.,Legwear
-1,Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.,Legwear
-1,I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.,Legwear

0,"I am 5' 10"" 135 lbs  normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact  the elastic is very loose  not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on  given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run",Legwear
0,I wanted to love these  but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute  but unfortunately must go back for me.,Legwear
0,"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.",Legwear

0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.,Legwear

-1,So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about  but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer  so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days  but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti,Lounge
-1,White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.,Lounge
-1,Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so  back it goes. and  i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!,Lounge

-1,I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home  i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck  and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t,Lounge
-1,I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person  i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent  and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.,Lounge
-1,I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus  it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!,Lounge
-1,I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered  but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good  but the back just looked like a big oversized  stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall  go for it!!,Lounge

0,I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.,Lounge
0,I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.,Lounge
0,I purchased this  and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green  and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall  unimpressed.,Lounge
0,These sleep pants are very pretty  soft and comfortable. unfortunately  after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?,Lounge

1,This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although  i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house.,Lounge
1,Love these pajama bottoms. they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique. i highly recommend. they run true to size and have a great length. they look short on the model but mine are perfect.,Lounge
1,Like the other reviewer mentioned  this jacket has a very trim fit  so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.,Lounge

1,This is a very comfortable and sexy sleep dress  the way it drapes. i can see that the type of fabric is not suitable for out and about activities and can catch on snags  etc. very easily. once i relegated it to the nightgown category it became my favorite item to wear and lounge in.,Lounge
1,I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it's just so cute  flattering  so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it's always the good stuff that can't be replaced,Lounge

0,Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high  and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around  it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2  but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt  i'd be totally in love.   as it is  i'll be returning it.,Outerwear

0,Really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms. i agree with the other reviewers  it's itchy  but so super cute. the sale price is a good deal. i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem. i got the xs/s  my usual size.,Outerwear
0,I agree with the other reviews that the sleeves can be tight even for those with slim arms. life would be great in this coat if my arms were always down by my sides. but when i lift my arms that's another story. i also agree that the material wrinkles easily. this is a high-maintenance item as far as pressing and ironing goes. it is a very pretty feminine coat but i would reconsider this only if it goes on sale.,Outerwear

1,This is a cute jacket  nice materials  comfortable  and feels very well made. i read some reviews about sizing and went with a small when i am usually an xs or s. the small was too big and boxy feeling  i think i would have liked it better if it felt like a more tailored fit. the design is definitely different and i played around with the collar drape thing but it felt a little awkward to me. overall  i think it's a cute jacket  but i sent it back  not for me.,Outerwear
1,Liked everything about this coat but the length! it is beautiful and good quality. first  ordered a medium because the fit seemed slight (i'm a 4-6)  returned it for a large. unfortunately  the large will also be returned -- the body length is very cropped  not at all as it appears in photo to meet the top of a waistband. i'll hope to find a similar coat with just a bit more length.,Outerwear

-1,"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick  stretchy and well made. however  the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great",Pants
-1,First  the good parts: these are adorable in person and (i think) the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures. the green isn't too army green  it's a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds  whites  blues  pinks...virtually any color.  the tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice. they do seem to run a little large  so i'd size down if you're between sizes.  and now  sadly  the bad: these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a,Pants

0,I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants  but sadly  they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build  these pants will be fantastic  but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean  vintage inspired  audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl  because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean  non-bulky lines (something like,Pants

-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts

0,I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper  etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.,Shorts

-1,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,Skirts
-1,This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.,Skirts

-1,While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through.   also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size  and i am usually a medium @ retailer  but i have a sm,Skirts
-1,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,Skirts
-1,This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist  tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts  but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.,Skirts
-1,"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6""  size 4  hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure.",Skirts
-1,Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.,Skirts
-1,This skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.,Skirts

0,Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking,Skirts
0,First  i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next  i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite  and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally  the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes  but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric  both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.,Skirts
0,I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.,Skirts
0,I received the moss skirt today. the material felt very soft and like good quality. i'm 5'4'  125 lbs and had ordered size 4 regular. unfortunately the skirt was huge and also very long  below the knees. the cut was not flattering for me as the material stuck out very wide on the sides. possibly a smaller size and petite would help but are sold out already in moss. plus i'm not sure the sticking out would be fixed  that might be the cut of the skirt. it didn't work for me and i will be returning,Skirts

0,Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips  the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition  i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.,Skirts
1,This skirt is exactly as i had hoped it would be. the zipper works great  the material feels nice  and the liner is attached to the skirt so there is no bunching effect. after the first time i wore the skirt i went out and bought more tops to go with it. i highly recommend this skirt.,Skirts
1,I have been wanting this skirt for a long time. i was worried about waist which is fitted. i finally ordered it and it i very cute. the waist is indeed fitted but there is some give to the fabric  fabric is soft cotton not unlike denim with some stretch. there i a soft cotton liner in skirt. i took the cloth belt off because i cannot retie it so neatly as in the photo  also i just don't want a bow on my stomach. i own a cute narrow belt that i will wear with skirt as i think something is needed,Skirts
